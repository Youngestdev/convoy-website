Convoy
======

Convoy is your one-stop tool for publishing and receiving webhooks. With our open source software, you have the flexibility to deploy the software to a location that best suites your infrastructure and ensure customer data never has to leave your infrastructure.

We found that APIs are quite pervasive, systems are interconnected as ever. Webhooks is the defacto paradigm for building notifications on the internet. But there isnâ€™t a defacto technology and tooling for handling all the naunces that comes with publishing, ingesting and debugging webhook events. 

Convoy solves that. We make it very easy for any engineer to add webhooks to their APIs and receive webhooks from their providers easily.

### Deploy Convoy
There are 2 ways of using Convoy: 
- **Convoy Cloud** - requires no setup, we manage the infrastructure, you publish & receive events. Please note: our cloud platform is in private beta and new users will be accepted on a case-by-case basis.
- **Self-Host** - requires setup, run in your infrastructure and maintain everything from there. User data stays in your infrastructure.

### Integrate Convoy

**API** 
You can use our [API](../docs/api) to publish events to Convoy.
